**About this repository:** This repository documents code used in the above article, and is not intended for ongoing code development. Sub-folders contain separate README workflow documents and scripts relevant to each of 7 case study datasets (described below).

**Raw data sources:** comprise type 2 diabetes data from [Forslund et al 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15766), based on earlier cohort data published by (Karlsson et al 2013)[https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12198] from Sweden and (Qin et al 2012)[https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12198] from China; together with post-mining ecosystem restoration case study data published by [Sun and Badgley 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0038071719301385?via%3Dihub).
